              <p>
                The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes a deadly disease, COVID-19
                 with a fatality rate between 2-3%. It has created havoc as it
                has engulfed the whole world, being declared a pandemic by the
                WHO. Lockdowns that have been imposed in almost all countries to
                save the citizens from the lethal infection have taken a toll,
                shattering economies. The disease has not spared even the
                advanced European countries, let alone the backward African
                countries and the developing Asian countries. The first and
                foremost job in the hands of the governments is not to save
                their people from the infection by imposing lockdown and social
                distancing only, but also to cope with the lockdown  to save the
                economies. The Indian Government is no exception. The Indian
                economy was already passing through a recession and experts were
                saying that the economy was heading towards depression even
                before the advent of the corona virus. COVID-19 has dealt a
                severe blow on the economy. It will be difficult to come out of
                this situation and depression once the lockdown is over.
              </p>
              <p>
                Against the backdrop of such a pandemic, it is obvious that the
                education sector will suffer in all the countries like many
                other sectors. The Indian education system has been badly
                affected by the entry of the disease and also because of social
                distancing measures that were taken to prevent the spread of the
                disease. The ultimate act on the part of the Central government
                has been to impose a lockdown on the entire country.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Impact of Corona Virus on Education</h3>
              
              <hr />
              <p>
                Even before the lockdown was enforced in the 3<sup>rd</sup> week
                of March, 2020, the state governments in their individual
                capacities declared the schools and colleges and the other
                educational institutions closed for a certain period of time
                from the middle of March. The closure was extended for some more
                time and finally the lockdown was declared. Thus the education
                system has been hampered for the last one and a half months.
                This is about regular classes in the educational institutions.
                Just before the full lockdown, international flights were banned
                from leaving and entering the country, thereby restricting
                people from going abroad to attend scheduled international
                seminars, workshops and also from visiting foreign universities
                for taking and giving classes and lectures etc. This was
                followed by cancellation of the national and domestic flights
                also thus resulting into people not being able to visit the
                places for educational purpose even inside the country. Finally
                with the lockdown, the trains also stopped running and thus the
                scheduled seminars etc had to be cancelled in all the stages,
                like, national, state and regional, and even local. Not only
                have seminars been cancelled, even visiting educational
                institutes for other purposes had to be postponed, for example,
                taking viva for thesis, projects etc and for other
                administrative purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the full lockdown being imposed in the country, the
                education sector initially came to a standstill. This is an
                unprecedented and unfamiliar situation, and nobody still knows
                when the situation will be normal. It is imperative that the
                lifting of lockdown should obviously not take place in one go,
                but gradually, as otherwise the very purpose of the imposition
                of lockdown will be defeated with the spreading of the disease
                again. It is also true that unless the social distancing
                measures are removed, bringing back normalcy will be difficult.
                It is a known fact that the educational institutions are most
                vulnerable for the spread of the disease due to the mass
                gathering in the classrooms. Therefore unless, the infection is
                totally eradicated from the states, it is difficult to bring
                back the students to the schools, colleges, universities and
                other educational institutions. Resuming normal classes in
                classrooms therefore seems a distant dream at this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gradually the system is getting accustomed to the situation.
                Distance classes, using various online platforms, have been
                started in many institutions. It is, however, difficult to say
                at this moment, how far it has been successful, especially when
                one is situated in an urban areas and has the advantage of
                teaching an elite class. As a teacher of one of the elite (and
                oldest) Universities of the country, I have the advantage of
                teaching an elite subject predominantly to urban students, where
                <u>all</u> students have smartphones although all of them may
                not have desktops and/or laptops. Even the few semi-urban and/or
                rural students in my class are used to having online chats on
                their smartphones. Since the hostels are closed now many
                students have gone back to their homes, some in rural areas
                where they cannot connect, mainly due to poor internet
                connectivity in their hometowns. The courses I teach are
                non-laboratory based, and are largely non-mathematical, so I am
                able to continue with online classes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The situation is very different when one looks at rural colleges
                and universities. Many students in rural areas may not have
                access to smartphones or computers. Even if they do, the net
                connectivity may not be as high as in urban areas. In any case,
                many students of the most elite institutions, the IITs, are not
                able to have access to online classes from their homes due to
                these reasons. Therefore some if not all of the universities,
                and some of the colleges have started online classes. The same
                can be said about other higher educational institutions, be they
                governmental, government-aided or autonomous.  Private
                institutions normally draw students from affluent urban classes,
                and hence do not face problems in dealing with this
                unprecedented situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The school education system portrays a dismal picture. There are
                many kinds of schools in the country: government,
                government-aided, private schools run by missionaries as well as
                those run by public and private trusts. There are also elite
                “public schools” and innumerable village level elementary
                schools under the <em>Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan</em> scheme, the
                latter catering to the below-poverty-level sections of society. 
                A majority of children (by number) attend village elementary and
                primary schools. Even in the urban areas, many such primary
                schools give classes to the poorer sections; most slum children
                attend these schools. In addition to the economic divide and the
                rural-urban divide there is a language divide as well.
                 Vernacular medium schools largely (though with exceptions)
                cater to the poor while English medium schools cater to other
                sections of the society. Here again comes the aspect of the
                digital divide: most poor students do not have access to
                smartphones, and even if they do, the net connectivity is poor
                and content is often not available in vernacular languages. This
                gives rise to discrimination in access to education.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today many schools in urban areas are having online classes,
                while the majority of rural schools do not. Very young children
                are not able to learn through online processes as they can
                neither handle computers nor mobile phones. In many households,
                there is no computer, and in many, children are not allowed
                smartphones as well. Both these problems exist regardless of
                class. Therefore, the digital divide at the school level leads
                to a gap between the haves and have-nots.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examinations have either been postponed or cancelled. Cancelling
                intermediate semesters or class annual exams or Class XI board
                exams will only weaken the foundations of the students. While it
                is true that online examinations are not possible at this time
                given the existing infrastructure in the country, already
                cancelling the exams kills the impetus of learning. The
                authorities could have waited for the lockdown to end before
                announcing such a drastic decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                India is a vast country with many complexities. The economic
                divide, the rural-urban divide and the resulting digital divide
                all have played an important role. The overall response of the
                country to the pandemic has thus been very mixed in the
                education sector.

              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">The future</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>
                Though the coronavirus entered India in the month of January, it
                was not until March that the seriousness of the situation was
                felt. For one and a half months now the education system has
                been   in the doldrums. In the meantime the severe economic
                effects of the lockdown have begun to be felt and there have
                been consequent social changes. No one knows at present, what
                the ultimate effect of this economic harshness t will be once
                the lockdown is over. The threat looms large particularly over
                low-income families. Many students belonging to low income
                families may not be in a position to  continue with their
                education due to a loss of income, especially those in the
                informal and unorganized sectors.  This may especially be true
                for science and other technical education. At the same time,
                guest teachers and ad hoc or para teachers in private
                educational institutes may lose their jobs as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far not much political change has been seen as a result of
                the pandemic. Social changes may emerge due to people staying at
                homes day after day, forced to spend time within small families
                and in limited space. The strain induced by the lockdown could
                have long-term effects, but how this will affect the higher
                education system is hard to predict right now. There is some
                evidence that domestic violence has increased, and there may be
                some effects on students’ education, especially if families
                break-up as a result of the lockdown. In any case, the resulting
                economic changes are sure to affect the higher education system
                indirectly.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Role of Technology</h3><hr />
              <p>
                Technology ought <u>not</u> to play a bigger role in teaching of
                economics in the post-corona period. It has already been
                mentioned how the digital divide plays an important role;
                therefore in order to reach all students, classroom teaching is
                the best option. This is especially true for laboratory-based
                subjects. While humanities related subjects may be taught
                online, the teaching will not reach all students. (Lab-based
                practical classes cannot be held online as it is not possible to
                set up labs at homes, but that is another story.) My subject,
                economics, has aspects of both humanities and science, requiring
                both lectures as well as (computer-based) practical work. The
                practical part of the course is difficult to conduct online
                since all students may not own computers and in addition, we
                need proprietary software etc. For courses with mathematics it
                is difficult to give instruction online as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Online classes are not capable of substituting classroom
                lectures. The former is very seldom able to generate the

                lectures and is imperative for their success, is also missing in

                discrimination, but also will create some practical problems. It

              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Impact of Online Education</h3><hr />
              <p>
                Calcutta University is large, catering to more than 20,000
                students each year. It also has around 150 undergraduate
                colleges under its purview. While it is difficult to gauge the
                impact of the online classes in the institution so early,
                students of all subjects do not have the access to online
                connectivity, especially those staying in the rural areas. The
                practical classes in the lab-based subjects are also not being
                held online and mathematical papers are difficult to be
                instructed online. Hence, it can be said that the impact has not
                been very positive.

              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Effects on Research</h3><hr />
              <p>
                Research has been affected in a negative way. While it is true
                that non-lab based research can be carried on through the
                students’ perseverance and the contact with the mentor through
                telephone calls or emails, but one-to-one correspondence, with
                face to face discussion has no substitute. In many cases, where
                secondary data are needed, the students cannot visit the sources
                like the institution itself, offices and libraries, as all data
                are not available online. Similarly, primary data collection has
                also stopped since visiting sources is forbidden, and hence
                research is severely hampered.  Mentorship improves only when
                there is face-to-face correspondence. In the lab-based subjects,
                research is totally stalled. Doctoral research has been
                hindered, both in primary and advanced stages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, M.Phil research has also slowed down. This is a cause
                for concern since M.Phil is a time bound project. There is a
                negative effect on project work as well. Thus on the whole there
                has been an adverse effect on research at <u>all</u> the levels
                due to the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting
                lockdown effect on the economy.

              <h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Conclusion</h3><hr />
              <p>
                It is safe to say that the present pandemic will not only affect
                the economy adversely, but it will also affect the education
                sector adversely in India. Already, one and a half months is
                lost. No one is sure how long it will take for the education
                sector to come out of the abnormal situation prevailing in the
                country at present. Moreover, education system is especially
                vulnerable since mass gathering cannot be avoided in our
                classrooms. Online classes are no substitutes for classroom
                lectures for a variety of reasons. The digital divide will only
                leads to discrimination and practical classes based on
                laboratories cannot be held online. Giving instructions for
                mathematical courses is also difficult online. The interaction
                between the teachers and the students is a crucial component of
                teaching and cannot be replicated in online classes. Research
                has been severely hampered due to the lockdown, and hence the
                sooner normalcy returns, the better.

                15 Free Mobile Apps That Will Help You Learn Almost Anything

                Your smartphone or tablet is good for more than just posting cat
                videos on social media. Shocking, I know! But, consider this:
                Mobile devices are one of the most important developments in the
                history of learning technology. Period. Just think about it.
                Before the advent of mobile apps, if you wanted to learn
                anything for free there was only a handful of ways to go about
                it:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Learn what you want to learn in school
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check out a book from the library
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find someone willing to teach you for free
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find someone willing to pay for you to learn
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learn the hard way, through trial and error
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Of course, there was learning software long before cell phones
                were invented, but, like textbooks, you either had to buy it or
                check it out from your local library. Aren’t you lucky to be
                alive in the Information Age? Now, here are 15 of the best free
                mobile learning apps available on Android and iOS.
              </p>
              <h3>
                1. Udemy
              </h3>
              <p>
                Udemy is an online service that offers a vast array of courses
                on everything from web development to personal development. Want
                to learn how to play the guitar? Whether you’re a beginner or a
                virtuoso, Udemy’s got dozens of courses to help. How about
                starting your own business? Yeah, they’ve got that, too.
                Virtually any subject you can think of, chances are Udemy has a
                course for it taught by an industry expert.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Udemy app allows you to access all of your courses’ videos
                and learning materials on the go through your mobile device.
                Just keep in mind, while the Udemy app itself is free to
                download, you’ll have to pay for each course you take. Some
                courses are longer and therefore more expensive than others. The
                good news is Udemy frequently hosts blowout sales on many of
                their offerings, allowing you to buy a $100-plus course for as
                little as ten bucks!
              </p>
              <h3>
                2. Lynda
              </h3>
              <p>
                Similar to Udemy, Lynda.com boasts a huge variety of courses in
                a whole slew of different subject areas, such as video
                production or software development. The Lynda mobile app
                likewise gives you the freedom to learn at your own pace,
                whenever and wherever it’s most convenient for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike Udemy, however, Lynda’s vast library of courses is
                offered on a monthly subscription basis, allowing you to take as
                many courses as you like each month. Not sure if you want to
                commit to a monthly payment? You can take Lynda for a no-risk,
                ten-day test drive for free.
              </p>
              <h3>
                3. Khan Academy
              </h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is the
                non-profit brainchild of Sal Khan (no, not the Star Trek
                villain) and is one of the best learning apps available. Before
                founding the world-famous organization, Khan was a teacher,
                entrepreneur, and hedge fund analyst. In 2012, he was named by
                Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s different about the Khan Academy app when comparing it to
                services like Udemy or Lynda, however, is that all its courses
                are offered 100% for free. Like, literally. You can take as many
                of Khan Academy’s professionally taught courses at absolutely
                zero cost to you. Most of the organization’s classes focus on
                more “academic” subjects, such as math, science, and the
                humanities, though there are some great courses in computer
                science, too.
              </p>

                4. TED
              </h3>
              <p>
                Touting itself as a repository of “knowledge in dangerously
                addictive short ideas,” TED is another non-profit organization
                dedicated to the spread of intriguing or inspirational thoughts,
                usually in videos of 18 minutes or less. These videos, dubbed
                “TED Talks” can be on a diverse range of subjects, from art to
                science to global issues. The TED mobile app gathers the entire
                TED video library into one place for your education and
                enjoyment, and all content is free to view.

              <p>
                If you want to build muscle, you go to the gym and hit the
                weights. But, what do you do if you want to work out your brain?
                The <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> app provides
                one solution by offering several series of brain-training
                “games” designed with the help of scientific experts and game
                developers. Lumosity’s brain exercises focus on improving your
                mental faculties, helping you learn new things, sharpen your
                focus, increase your retention, and solve problems faster and
                more efficiently. As with other apps mentioned in this list, the
                Lumosity mobile app is free to download to your device. But, to
                get the most out of the app, you might consider subscribing to
                Lumosity’s monthly service.

              <p>
                Even in today’s digital world, books are still one of the best
                ways to learn about almost anything you can think of. There’s
                just one problem: There are a bazillion different books on a
                kajillion different subjects out there, and some of them are
                better than others. For instance, which books should you read if
                you want to gain skills in graphic design software such as Adobe
                Photoshop®, Illustrator®, or InDesign®? That’s where
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> comes in.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 40 million members, Goodreads is basically the
                Facebook of, well, books. Their mission is to get the right book
                in the right hands at the right time, whether it’s fiction,
                nonfiction, or self-help. No matter what your interests, the
                free Goodreads app can probably point you toward the perfect
                book to help you learn whatever it is you want to learn. You can

                9. Wikipedia
              </h3>
              <p>
                There once was a time when people actually had multiple volumes
                of the encyclopedia on their bookshelves. Nowadays, we have
                <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. The
                Wikipedia app is a wellspring of knowledge on virtually every
                subject from academics to pop culture. Instead of lugging around
                multiple heavy volumes of the encyclopedia, you can now access
                millions of articles at your fingertips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students be warned, however. Because anyone can edit articles in
                Wikipedia, most teachers do not consider it a reliable source of
                information for essays and other assignments. Instead of citing
                Wikipedia as the source, look up the original sources listed at
                the bottom of a specific Wikipedia article and then cite those
                in your research papers.

                Like Wikipedia, anyone can upload a video to YouTube, so be
                aware that some learning videos will be more reliable than
                others. How do you know whether a video on a certain subject is
                trustworthy? Look for one that’s made or has been posted by an
                expert with real-world experience in the subject you’re
                interested in.
