				<p><span><span><strong>Introduction</strong></span></span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>There is still a great deal of uncertainty about the impacts of COVID-19 and governments’ possible responses to limit the pandemic’s human and economic effects. The current policy debate centres around the following key questions:</span></span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span> What does the ‘typical’ path of economic performance and recovery of countries that have experienced a health and economic crisis look like?</span></span>
					</li>
					<li><span><span> Which countries and regions are most affected by the COVID-19 crisis?</span></span>
					</li>
					<li><span><span> What are the most effective policy responses to mitigate the impacts of the crisis and to accelerate the recovery process?</span></span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>To address the first question, </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><a href="https://voxeu.org/article/modern-health-crises-recession-and-recovery">Ma et al. (2020)</a></span> </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span> recently conducted an econometric analysis to examine the paths of countries’ growth rates following a health crisis. (</span></span><span><span>The crises they analyze include the 1968 Flu (aka Hong Kong Flu), SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016). Authors acknowledge that COVID – 19 is more widespread than the average crisis in the sample and that the estimates are highly likely to be a lower bound for the effect of COVID-19 globally.) <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>On average, GDP growth in affected countries is about 2.4% below that of unaffected countries. The GDP growth reduction is followed by a quick recovery with affected countries enjoying a one percentage point higher growth rate than unaffected countries in the year following the crisis. After an initial upturn during that first year, however, the economic recovery may stall and </span></span>
					</span>
					</span><span><span>GDP growth may persistently remain lower in affected countries compared to unaffected countries. </span></span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>Ma et al. (2020) also find that the decline in GDP growth is, on average, less severe in low-income countries experiencing a health crisis than it is in advanced economies experiencing a health crisis and is not statistically more severe in affected low income countries from unaffected low income countries. Moreover, they find a robust impact of fiscal policy stimulus on recovery performance. The question therefore arises whether COVID-19 might be less harrowing for developing countries than it has been for developed ones. </span></span>

					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>Data for the first quarter of 2020 suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced global trade values by 3 per cent. This downturn is expected to accelerate in the second quarter of 2020, with world trade projected to record a quarter-on-quarter decline of 27 per cent, according to the latest <a href="https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2369">UNCTAD assessment</a>.</span></span>
				</p>
				<p><strong><span><span><span>New evidence III: North America and Asia expected to suffer more from global trade decline</span></span></span></strong></p>
				<p><span><span>Nearly all regions are expected to suffer double-digit declines in trade volume, even in the most optimistic scenarios. In a regional comparison, as illustrated in Figure 5, North America and Asia are predicted to suffer the highest negative impacts on their export volumes (Figure 5). </span></span>

				<p><strong><span><span><span>New evidence IV: Unemployment rates are skyrocketing, with the Americas, Europe and Central Asia hit hardest </span></span></span></strong></p>
				<p><span><span>Unemployment rates are skyrocketing to unprecedented levels. The third edition of the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/coronavirus/lang--en/index.htm">ILO Monitor</a> on COVID-19’s impact on labour contends that the share of workers affected by temporary workplace closures has decreased from 81 per cent to 68 per cent over the last two weeks. The losses in working hours, however, remain high. While working hours are expected to decrease in all regions, the ´Americas´ and ´Europe and Central Asia´ will be hit hardest with 12,4 per cent and 11,8 per cent, respectively (Figure 6). </span></span>

				<p><strong><span><span><span>New evidence V: Sub-Saharan Africa severely affected by poverty</span></span></span></strong></p>
				<p><span><span>As Figure 7 illustrates, the regional distribution of the expected increase in extreme poverty is heavily skewed towards sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with nearly 50 per cent of those pushed below the poverty line living in sub-Saharan Africa. The <a href="https://www.uneca.org/publications/policy-brief-impact-covid-19-africa">UN Economic Commission for Africa</a> arrives at a similar conclusion, where a projected GDP contraction of -2.6 per cent in the worst case could deprive 19 million people of their livelihoods and, in the context of weak social protection programmes in Africa, push up to an additional 29 million people into poverty.</span></span>

Far from being exhaustive, the data allow us to capture some initial trends (data are seasonally adjusted to take into account that countries produce different volumes of goods throughout different periods of the year). The sample of 48 countries comprises 30 high-income countries, 15 upper middle-income countries and three lower middle-income countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

The average negative growth rates across the 48 countries are -4.8 per cent and -4.6 per cent, respectively.

				<p><span><span>We repeat the same exercise by weighting the reduction rate of the IIP and take the size of the economy, represented by manufacturing value added, into account. This is important to ensure that the reduction rates of small countries do not skew the calculated averages. The IIP’s average reduction rates (Table 3) are amplified by the fact that many countries with an extremely negative industrial performance are those that are the most industrialized (e.g. USA, China, and high-income European countries). </span></span>

				<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>As the pandemic’s epicentre shifted—first from Asia to Europe, then to the Americas and the rest of the world—and as some countries have gradually started resuming economic activities, two interrelated issues have gained centre stage in the economic policy debate: (1) how to shape recovery plans to foster a more inclusive and sustainable post-crisis world; and (2) how to boost international support for developing countries to ensure their economic survival and to bolster their fragile healthcare systems, while sowing the seeds for a better </span></span><span><span>future. Both of these issues have major implications for industrial development opportunities and policies. </span></span>

				<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Support for business survival is key to curb the pandemic’s immediate effects</span></strong><span></span></span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>Governments’ responses to the pandemic have focussed primarily on the immediate health emergency and its economic effects, thus seeking to safeguard the provision of healthcare and support for individuals, households and businesses. Yet there is a huge disparity across countries and regions in terms of their capacity to mobilize the necessary fiscal and financial resources. While countries such as Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom have allocated large amounts of funds to cushion the pandemic’s blow on their businesses (i.e. through subsidies, loans, guarantees, tax relief or deferral), access to credit in the developing world remains elusive, sometimes even regardless of firm size, according to a recent survey of <a href="https://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/PublicationFiles/eca-iec_survey_covid-19_africa_english_final.pdf">UNECA and IEC</a> on African businesses.</span></span>

				<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Effective support measures, accompanied by coordinated efforts, could help least developed countries ride out the storm</span></strong>
					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>In light of the uneven government capacities to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, calls for the international community to coordinate efforts and provide effective support measures, especially for least developed countries (LDC), have increased. Given that such coordinated efforts have yet to materialize, businesses and governments in both developed and developing countries have been leading initiatives to mobilize scientific, technological and productive capacities towards critical goods. In the context of developing countries, however, such initiatives appear insufficient to contain the impacts of the pandemic and to provide the necessary supplies. In a recent policy brief, the <a href="https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/45510-restricciones-la-exportacion-productos-medicos-dificultan-esfuerzos-contener-la">UN Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean</a> highlighted that the region is highly dependent on medical goods imports, with less than 4 per cent originating in the region itself. Insofar as four of the top five suppliers in the region have restricted their medical supply exports in response to COVID-19, Latin America and the Caribbean remain vulnerable. Nevertheless, public-private partnerships have developed in the region, providing evidence of the possibility to unite efforts towards a common goal and setting an important precedent for a medium- to long-term strategy to build resilient health industries. </span></span>

					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>As some economies are starting to reopen after economic lockdowns and are gradually resuming manufacturing activities, it is undisputable that workers’ health and safety guidelines are instrumental in preventing a second wave of contagion. During the early stages of the pandemic, governments’ responses differed in terms of stringency and clarity, as well as coordination capacity. </span></span>

				<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Innovation policies can foster recovery from COVID-19 effects on the economy</span></strong>
					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>Many companies have been forced due to containment measures to develop new business models and ways to organize production to survive in the short term, and ensure long-term viability and growth. Such changes may eventually benefit from the support of science, technology and innovation (STI) policies through grants, credit and tax breaks, among other instruments. Yet as innovation features as one of the key drivers of economic growth, it is expected that STI policies should also contribute to fostering economic recovery in the medium- to long run by enabling economic restructuring, productive diversification and entry/repositioning in what is expected to be a changed landscape of global value chains once the pandemic has been controlled (<a href="https://iap.unido.org/articles/foster-recovery-covid-19-through-science-technology-and-innovation">Santiago et al. 2020</a>). </span></span>

					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>In a recent opinion piece, <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-05-13/Making-the-best-of-a-post-pandemic-world-Qs9V3nQNgI/index.html">Rodrik</a> discusses the trends that will shape the global economy in the years to come. He identifies the rebalancing of state-market relations (with a greater presence of the former) and a rebalancing between hyper-globalization and national autonomy (to the benefit of the latter). In fact, some governments are already considering the windows of opportunity these trends might offer to strengthen and develop their local manufacturing capacities. The Indian government, for example, has announced a relief package for industry with an explicit view to achieving self-reliance while enhancing the country’s competitiveness in the global economy (Banerji, 2020).</span></span>

					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>As documented in the past weeks, the halt in economic activities, while negatively affecting socio-economic conditions, has led to an improvement in the environment in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. <a href="https://www.manufacturingglobal.com/leadership/time-more-sustainable-practices-manufacturing">Surveys</a> show that climate change and sustainability are key concerns among manufacturing workers, which suggests that they would welcome a shift towards greener practices in the post-crisis period and beyond. </span></span>

					</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p><span><span>Whether a consensus is beginning to evolve on the need to follow more inclusive and sustainable paths once the pandemic has been contained is not yet clear. In this vein, export-oriented industrialization may be a less viable vehicle for recovery from COVID-19 and for longer term development, which should compel developing countries to rethink their growth models and strategies. This means not only addressing emergencies, but also including policies aimed at expanding productive capacities, promoting economic diversification and technological upgrading, while ensuring social and environmental protection. For that to become a reality, however, global coordination is key.<strong><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"></span></u>
