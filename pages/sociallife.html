            The pandemic has impacted religion in various ways, including the
            cancellation of the worship services of various faiths, the
            closure of Sunday Schools, as well as the cancellation of
            pilgrimages surrounding observances and festivals.Many churches,
            synagogues, mosques, and temples have offered worship through
            livestream amidst the pandemic.Relief wings of religious
            organisations have dispatched medical supplies and other aid to
            affected areas. Adherents of many religions have gathered together
            to pray for an end to the pandemic, for those affected by it, as
            well as for the God they believe in to give physicians and
            scientists the wisdom to combat the disease;in the United States,
            Trump designated 15 March 2020 as a National Day of Prayer for
            "God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation".

            On 18 March 2020, the World Health Organization issued a report
            related to mental health and psychosocial issues by addressing
            instructions and some social considerations during the COVID-19
            outbreak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to doubts if pets or other livestock may pass on coronavirus
            to humans, many people were reluctant to keep their pets fearing
            transmission, for instance in the Arab World, celebrities were
            urging people to keep and protect their pets.Meanwhile, people in
            the U.K. tended to acquire more pets during the coronavirus
            lockdown.

          <p>
            The coronavirus pandemic has been followed by a concern for a
            potential spike in suicides, exacerbated by social isolation due
            to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and
            unemployment and financial factors.

            Chaos and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have
            made a catastrophic future seem less remote and action to prevent
            it more necessary. However, it may also have the opposite effect
            by having minds focus on the more immediate threat of the pandemic
            rather than the climate crisis or the prevention of other
            disasters.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The impact on personal gatherings has been strong as medical
            experts have advised, and local authorities often mandated
            stay-at-home orders to prevents gatherings of any size, not just
            the larger events that were initially restricted. Such gatherings
            may be replaced by teleconferencing, or in some cases with
            unconventional attempts to maintain social distancing with
            activities such as a balcony sing-along for a concert, or a
            "birthday parade" for a birthday party. Replacements for
            gatherings have been seen as significant to mental health during
            the crisis.

            Main article: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic violence
          </div>
          <p>
            Many countries have reported an increase in domestic violence and
            intimate partner violence attributed to lockdowns amid the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Financial insecurity, stress, and uncertainty
            have lead to increased aggression at home, with abusers able to
            control large amounts of their victims' daily life. United Nations
            Secretary-General António Guterres has called for a domestic
            violence "ceasefire".

          <h1 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Elderly care</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Older people are particularly affected by COVID-19. They need
            special attention during the COVID-19 crisis, and their voices,
            opinions and concerns are important in formulating responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Global data are extremely uncertain at present, nonetheless, the
            heightened risks of COVID-19 for older persons are evident in all
            national data. The scale of testing and nature of reporting vary
            between governments and hence there is risk of misinformation by
            generalizing from the experience and reports of a given country.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the number of older persons is relatively and absolutely
            smaller in developing countries, particularly in Africa, this
            coincides with other serious structural risks. Countries with the
            fewest older persons (such as many of the least developed
            countries), have the fewest health resources, limited experience
            caring for older patients (including few geriatric specialists),
            less institutional care for older persons, and far fewer public or
            NGO support structures for outreach, screening and community-based
            care of older persons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Older persons living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing
            homes and rehabilitation centers, are particularly vulnerable to
            infection and adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Older persons who
            live alone may face barriers to obtaining accurate information,
            food, medication, and other essential supplies during quarantine
            conditions and community outreach is required. Older persons,
            especially in isolation, those with cognitive decline, and those
            who are highly care-dependent, need a continuum of practical and
            emotional support through informal networks (families), health
            workers, caregivers, and volunteers.
